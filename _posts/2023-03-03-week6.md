## Schedule
- Intro to JSON
- In-class JSON exercise
- 1:1 Technical Meeting

## Homework
- Continue working on Assignment 3: Responsive Web Layout


## Intro to JavaScript

So far in this class, we have covered using HTML to structure the content of the webpages and CSS to stylize these content. For the next part of this class, we will use JavaScript to make static webpages dynamic.

What is JavaScript?



## Intro to JSON

### What is JSON?

- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight format for data exchanges between servers and web application.
- It is derived from JavaScript as its name suggests but it can be used in many other languages such as Python.
- It's more readable, and more compact in terms of size, and easier to be parsed using JavaScript comparing to other data formats such as XML and CSV when it comes to web development.

### Comparing JSON, CSV, XML

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "age": 20,
      "major": "Computer Science"
    },
    {
      "name": "Emily",
      "age": 18,
      "major": "Fashion Design"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike",
      "age": 22,
      "major": "Communication Design"
    }
  ]
}
```

```csv
Name, Age, Major
John, 20, Computer Science
Emily, 18, Fashion Design
Mike, 22, Communication Design
```

```xml
<users>
  <user>
    <name>John</name>
    <age>20</age>
    <occupation>Computer Science</occupation>
  </user>
  <user>
    <name>Emily</name>
    <age>18</age>
    <occupation>Fashion Design</occupation>
  </user>
  <user>
    <name>Mike</name>
    <age>22</age>
    <occupation>Communication Design</occupation>
  </user>
</users>
```

- In JSON, data is represented as a series of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. The values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or other objects, and the keys are used to identify the values. In this example, the data is represented as an object with a single key ("users"), which contains an array of objects representing each user's data.

- In XML, data is represented as a tree structure of nested tags. Each tag represents a different element of the data, and the contents of the tag represent the value of that element.

- In CSV, data is represented as a series of values separated by commas. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a different attribute of that record.

### Creating JSON Data
JSON Syntax Rules
- Data is in key/value pairs
- Data is separated by commas
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays

To bring down each rules,
- Data is always represented in pairs, where each key comes with a value, enclosed by curly braces `{ }`
- Key has to be strings, enclosed by double quotes `" "`
- Values can be strings, numbers, boolean values (`true` or `false`), arrays(represented as a list of values enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`)
- Multiple key-value pairs are separated by commas `,`
- JSON does not allow for comments

```js

/*
 * How to Convert Google Sheet to JSON
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Create a new Google Sheet or open an existing one that you want to convert to JSON.
 * 2. In the Google Sheet, go to the "Extensions" menu and select "Apps Script".
 * 3. In the `Code.gs` file, delete any existing code and paste the following code:
 * 4. Save this gist and click on "Run" button to execute the script. If prompted, make sure to grant access to your Google Sheet.
 * 5. Open the "Log" window, to see the converted JSON Data
 * 6. To download the JSON data, copy and paste into a text editor or a JSON formatter such as https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
 *
 */

function convertSheetToJson() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var range = sheet.getDataRange();
  var values = range.getValues();
  var headers = values.shift();

  var json = [];
  values.forEach(function(row) {
    var obj = {};
    row.forEach(function(value, i) {
      obj[headers[i]] = value;
    });
    json.push(obj);
  });

  var jsonString = JSON.stringify(json, null, 2);
  Logger.log(jsonString);
}
```

This script works by first getting the active sheet and the range of cells that contain data. It then retrieves the values from the range and stores them in an array. The headers row is removed from the array and stored separately. Then, the data is transformed into an array of objects where each object represents as row in the sheet, with keys being the headers and values being the corresponding data in each row. Finally, the resulting JSON data is logged to the console and can be copied and used as needed.

### Parse JSON Data

High-level pseudo-code

- Load JSON file using either fetch or XMLHttpRequest
- Parse the data using [JSON.parse()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)
- Use DOM to display JSON data on a webpage



### DEMO

```html
    <h2>Class Roster</h2>
    <ul id="list"></ul>
```

```js
fetch('data.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Get the list element
        const list = document.getElementById('list');
                
        // Loop through the data and add each item to the list
        data.forEach(item => {
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        const a = document.createElement('a');

        // Set the text content and href attributes for the link
        a.textContent = item.Name;
        a.href = "https://" + item.Github + ".github.io";

        // Add the link to the list item and the list item to the list
        li.appendChild(a);
        list.appendChild(li);
        });
    })
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This is a JavaScript code snippet that uses the fetch function to make a network request for a JSON file named data.json, and then processes the response using two chained then methods.

The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the network response. The first then method is called when the Promise is resolved, and it takes the Response object as its parameter. 

The second then method is called when the Promise returned by the json() method is resolved, and it takes the parsed JSON data as its parameter. In this code, the arrow function inside the second then method uses the parsed JSON data to manipulate the DOM (the HTML document).
