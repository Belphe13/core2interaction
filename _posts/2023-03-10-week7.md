## Intro to JavaScript

So far in this class, we have covered using HTML to structure the content of the webpages and CSS to stylize these content. For the next part of this class, we will use JavaScript to make static webpages dynamic.

What is JavaScript?



## Intro to DOM

- DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents that allows for dynamic manipulation and modification of HTML and XML documents.

- The DOM represents the document as a tree-like structure of nodes and elements, with each node representing a part of the document.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is my website.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In DOM Tree:
```
- Document (root)
  - html
    - head
      - title
        - "My Website"
    - body
      - h1
        - "Welcome"
      - p
        - "This is my website."
```

### Access Elements in DOM

- `document.getElementById()` selects an element by its ID attribute

- `document.getClassName()` selects an element by its class attribute

- `document.querySelector()` selects an elements by the first matching element using a CSS selector

- `document.querySelectorAll()` selects all matching elements using a CSS selector

### Modify Elements in DOM

- `innerHTML` to get or set the HTML content of an element

- `innerText` or `textContent` to get or set the text content of an element.

- `setAttribute()` to set an attribute on an element

- `style` to set an attribute on an element

### Create and Remove Element in DOM

- `document.createElement()` creates a new element

- `parentElement.appendChild()` adds a new element to the end of a parent element

- `parentElement.insertBefore()` adds a new element before an existing child element.

- `parentElement.removeChild()` removes an existing child element.

### Responding to Events in DOM

- `addEventListener()` to attach an event listener to an element

- `event` - 

- `preventDefault()`

- `stopPropagation()`
