## Homework
- Continue to work on Project 2, DUE 3/28
- [JSON Template: Pokedex](https://github.com/lilanyang/lilanyang.github.io/tree/main/json-demo-pokedex)

## In-Class Exercise
Watch [Intro to JavaScript](https://vimeo.com/513584741) and [JavaScript + DOM](https://vimeo.com/519265257) using password: interaction. After watching the video, write about your understanding of DOM and how you can use it to parse your JSON file in one paragraph with at least 5 sentences.

## JSON Template: Pokedex
1. Load your JSON file
  
    Inside the `<script>` tag where JavaScript codes are located, you first see the fetch function to access the correct JSON file

    ```javascript
    fetch('pokemon.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {

        // write your code here

        })
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
    ``` 

2. Access the div element which your dataset would be located within your html page

    Select the div or section with a designated id, you can use document.getElementById to select your element by id attribute.

3. Loop through the data and add items to your div

    ```javascript
    data.forEach(item => { //write your code here 
    });
    ``` 

4. Within the loop, create the new elements using DOM

    ```javascript
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    ```

    For example, you can create a const with any name, in this case, "img" to create a new element for <img>

5. Set text content and href attributes etc for the links

    Since both images and audio files are hosted on my GitHub repo, you can link write img.src by finding the right folder and link the right field name in the JSON file. In this case, inside a folder called "img" a file named "pikachu.png" is under the "image" category, so we write "img/" + item.image to be the source to access the images.

6. Add these newly defined HTML tags to the webpage.

    In this example the following code,

    ```javascript
    div.appendChild(img);
    div.appendChild(p);
    div.appendChild(audio);
    pokedex.appendChild(div);
    ```

  is equivalent to

    <div id="pokedex">
    <div>
      <img src="">
      <p></p>
      <audio src=""></audio>
    </div>
    </div>
